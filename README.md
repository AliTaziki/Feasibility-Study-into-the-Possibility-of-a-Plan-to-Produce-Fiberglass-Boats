# Feasibility-Study-into-the-Possibility-of-a-Plan-to-Produce-Fiberglass-Boats
This project is related to “Engineering Economics” course. In this project, we were given a wide range of information on a plan to produce fiberglass boats. We had to distinguish useful data from useless and then compute NPV factor to recognize whether or not the proposed plan was economical.
